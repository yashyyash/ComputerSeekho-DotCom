Got it — you have:

* **`batch`** ? details of a specific batch (name, dates, photo, etc.)
* **`course`** ? details of a specific course (name, fee, syllabus, etc.)
* **`batch_course`** ? a *link table* (also called a junction table) that connects batches to courses.

---

## **Why `batch_course` exists**

This table enables a **many-to-many** relationship between `batch` and `course`.

* A **batch** can cover **multiple courses** (e.g., one batch might learn PGDAC + MSCIT).
* A **course** can be offered in **multiple batches** (e.g., PGDAC might be taught in August and September batches).

Instead of putting `course_id` directly inside `batch` (which would limit each batch to one course), `batch_course` lets you link **any number of courses to any batch**.

---

## **Example Data**

Let’s say:

* `batch_id` 1 ? Java Full Stack - August 2025
* `batch_id` 2 ? Python Data Science - September 2025
* `batch_id` 3 ? Web Development - October 2025
* `course_id` 1 ? PGDAC
* `course_id` 2 ? DBDA
* `course_id` 3 ? MSCIT

We can insert relationships like this:

```sql
INSERT INTO batch_course (batch_id, course_id) VALUES
(1, 1), -- Batch 1 teaches PGDAC
(2, 2), -- Batch 2 teaches DBDA
(3, 3), -- Batch 3 teaches MSCIT
(4, 1), -- Batch 4 teaches PGDAC
(5, 2); -- Batch 5 teaches DBDA
```

---

### **How It Works**

If you run:

```sql
SELECT b.batch_name, c.course_name
FROM batch_course bc
JOIN batch b ON bc.batch_id = b.batch_id
JOIN course c ON bc.course_id = c.course_id;
```

You’ll get a list of **which batches are teaching which courses**.

---

If you want, I can also **map your newly created 5 batches** to the existing 3 courses in a realistic schedule so you can directly insert and use them for student enrollment.
