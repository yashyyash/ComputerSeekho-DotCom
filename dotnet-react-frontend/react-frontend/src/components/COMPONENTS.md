# 🧩 React + Vite Project Structure — Computer Seekho

This frontend is structured using a clean and scalable approach with separate **components** and **pages**.

---

## 📁 Component Organization

You’ve got the following in your `src/components/` folder:


Each component has:
- `.jsx` for structure/logic
- `.css` for its styling

✅ This is good — clean, modular, and easy to manage.

---

## 🧱 Pages vs Components

- **Components** are small building blocks (Header, Hero, Navbar, etc.)
- **Pages** like `Home.jsx` combine components to make full screens

🛠 Example:
```jsx
// Home.jsx
import Header from '../components/Header';
import CoursesOffered from '../components/CoursesOffered';

function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <Header />
      <CoursesOffered />
    </>
  );
}
```

## 📁 Component Organization

 `src/components/` folder:

```

components/
├── Header.jsx & Header.css
├── Hero.jsx & Hero.css
├── Navbar.jsx & Navbar.css
├── NotificationBar.jsx & NotificationBar.css
├── CoursesOffered.jsx & CoursesOffered.css

````

Each component has:
- `.jsx` for structure/logic
- `.css` for its styling

✅ This is good — clean, modular, and easy to manage.

## 🧱 Pages vs Components

- **Components** are small building blocks (Header, Hero, Navbar, etc.)
- **Pages** like `Home.jsx` combine components to make full screens

🛠 Example:
```jsx
// Home.jsx
import Header from '../components/Header';
import CoursesOffered from '../components/CoursesOffered';

function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <Header />
      <CoursesOffered />
    </>
  );
}
````

📍 Then in `App.jsx`, we hook this page to a route:

```jsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
</Routes>
```

---

## 🧠 `main.jsx` vs `App.jsx`

* `main.jsx` is the app entry point — sets up things like `BrowserRouter`, and renders `<App />` to the DOM.
* `App.jsx` is where layout and routes are defined.

🔁 Think of it like:

> `main.jsx` boots the app → `App.jsx` builds the app layout

---

## 🔧 Better Structure As You Grow

As your app grows, it's a good idea to start grouping component files:

```
components/
├── Header/
│   ├── Header.jsx
│   └── Header.css
```

And eventually:

* Use **CSS Modules** for scoped styling
* Use **PropTypes** or **TypeScript** for safer props

---

This way of organizing keeps everything neat, reusable, and scalable without confusion.
